I'm a theoretical physicist focused on understanding what exists Beyond the Standard Models of particle physics and cosmology 
by working at the junction of high energy theory and the real world. 
I have broad interests across many aspects of particle physics, field theory, cosmology, and gravity, 
and I enjoy collaborating, mentoring, and other forms of talking about physics.

I'm quite proud of [my dissertation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11870), which begins with an extensive introduction aiming to pedagogically explain renormalization and the hierarchy problem.
I place considerable focus on clearing conceptual pitfalls and on debunking common misconsceptions, and I've been flattered to hear that it is a useful resource for the community.

My thesis also received the APS 2022 [Sakurai Dissertation Award](https://www.aps.org/programs/honors/prizes/particle.cfm) in Theoretical Particle Physics,
though that was more about the sections on my own research. 
 
Recently I was honored to be invited to give the Enrico Fermi Institute's 91st [Compton Lectures](https://efi.uchicago.edu/events/compton-lecture-series/), 
a series of lectures each Saturday for the general public over eight weeks in Spring 2023. I delivered a wide-ranging series of lectures with the title 
"Particles, the Cosmos, and You: An Origin Story from the Edges of Space and Time" aimed at presenting our well-understood, empirical answers to age-old questions 
like "What are we made of?" and "Where did we come from?" through the lens of fundamental particle physics and cosmology.
