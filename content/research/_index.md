I will write some things here at an accessible level about some of my work. 
For now, my publications can be viewed on [inspireHEP](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1503310).

It seems my research program has become trying to learn the past half-century of theoretical physics beyond the standard model 
and understand all the possible hints of new physics and try to point out possibilities and connections that all the brilliant 
senior physicists who were thinking about these topics in real-time have missed.

Yeah, I'm not sure how well it's going to work out either.
