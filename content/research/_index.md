I will write some things here at an accessible level about some of my work. 
For now, my publications can be viewed on [inspireHEP](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1503310).

It seems my research program has become trying to learn the past half-century of theoretical physics beyond the standard model 
and understand all the possible hints of new physics and try to point out possibilities and connections that all the brilliant 
senior physicists who were learning these topics in real time have missed. 

This is a program borne out of ignoring all sensible advice on specialization and how to divide time between performing new 
calculations versus mentoring undergrads or spending effort on write pedagogical papers or reading old papers. 
As of this writing, I still believe this to be a valuable pursuit, but we shall see what it gets me.
