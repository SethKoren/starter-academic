I will write some things here at an accessible level about some of my work. 
For now, my publications can be viewed on [inspireHEP](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1503310) or in [NASA ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/user/libraries/p3Td-T-LTKeAod3Gn48UEA) or on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yYrr0jUAAAAJ).

My main research interest is to understand how the world around us came to be, both by learning how the universe works at its smallest scales and by understanding the evolution of the universe in its earliest moments.
