I will write some things here at an accessible level about some of my work. 
For now, my publications can be viewed on [inspireHEP](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1503310).

It seems my research program has become trying to learn the past half-century of theoretical physics beyond the standard model 
and understand all the possible hints of new physics, and then trying to point out possibilities and connections that all the brilliant 
senior physicists who were thinking over these topics in real time as they were developed have missed. 

This is a program borne out of ignoring all sensible advice on what topics to think about and specialization and writing pedagogical materials and reading old papers. 
As of this writing, I still believe this to be a valuable pursuit, but we shall see where it gets me.
