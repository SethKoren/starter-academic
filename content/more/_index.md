Be warned, I do open up in here. 
In particular, I speak more candidly about mental health and neurophysiological illness than is often done publicly.
In doing so, I hope to help normalize such conversations---which I think is really going to be needed as we collectively recover from the pandemic.

I expand on this motivation at the end of this page. For now let me note that it is only over lockdown I have 
been working on articulating these things, so you'll have to forgive any rough edges in their expression or time-dependence in my understanding.
