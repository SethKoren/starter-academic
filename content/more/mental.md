Yes, there will be something in detail about mental health experiences and challenges here. In hindsight, these began quite early on, but 
I had little mental health education, and was explicitly not allowed to have any sort of mental health issues myself. Disease was due to 
failing to live a 'natural' life, but we never used 'chemicals' or ate 'processed' food or got vaccinated, so it wasn't possible for us to have any illnesses.
