Yes, there will be something in detail about mental health experiences and challenges here. In hindsight, these began quite early on, but 
I had little mental health education, and was explicitly not allowed to have any sort of mental health issues myself. Illness was due to 
failing to live a 'natural' life, but we never used 'chemicals' or ate 'processed food' or got vaccinated, so it wasn't possible for us to have such ailments.

# I think if one were watching a stageplay of my life, my issues with social anxiety would have been apparent quite early on.
# But after I started attending a middle school an hour away from home, it became rapidly apparent that others weren't interested in .

# Eventually I began to think of this as something I was bad at.
