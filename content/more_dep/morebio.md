I was raised in what was effectively an anti-science cult of my father's manufacture. He is a figure of some prominence in the anti-vaccine movement.
Of course as with any religion my parents I was indoctrinated into all of this completely for many years. As a devotee I advocated 'alternative medicine' and conspiracy theories. In eighth grade I asked my science teacher why he had decided not to teach creationism. 

As a family we didn't see medical doctors, so none were able to notice my early symptoms which began in childhood, and included developmental delays of various sorts. In hindsight many difficulties were rooted in this fact.
After clear, serious symptoms began I spent four years pleading to see a doctor, during which I was disallowed from referring to myself with words like "disease" or "sick".
Neither the acupuncturists nor the homeopaths nor the chiropractors helped, despite many false promises, 
and no usage of hypnotism or crystals or massage or magnets or astrology or pilgrimage or tarot or essential oils or incense or any of the other 'alternative therapies' to which I was subjected were of any use.  

Early in my senior year of high school I managed to see a doctor who immediately recognized my (really very obvious) endocrinological symptoms. 
After an MRI I was diagnosed with two intracranial germinomas---brain tumors---and told I might die. Child protective services became involved.

Determined not to delay my schooling, I applied to colleges a couple months later. 
My school's college advisers told me I shouldn't mention my brain injury in my college essay. 
Ever overly concerned with what should be rather than what is, I ignored their advice. 
After a flurry of rejections I ended up taking a year off and applying to colleges again. I didn't make the same mistake.

Once at Penn and on the mandatory student health insurance I was finally able to be a patient of an endocrinologist. 
On my first visit he prescribed me a safe, cheap, wonderful pharmaceutical which greatly improved my quality of life. 
Among other things, for the first time in six years I was able to sleep continuously for more than ~2 hours.

I haven't had any contact with my parents since undergrad.
